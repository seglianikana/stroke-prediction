# 🧠 Stroke Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a stroke in individuals based on various health and demographic factors. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes features such as age, gender, BMI, glucose level, smoking status, and more.

We conduct a full end-to-end analysis — including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and training a Random Forest classifier to predict stroke risk.
## 📊 Project Overview
- Performed data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features

- Explored the data through visualizations to identify trends and correlations related to stroke occurrence

- Built and evaluated a Random Forest model to classify individuals based on stroke risk

- Assessed model performance using accuracy on both training and testing datasets

- Identified most important features influencing the prediction
